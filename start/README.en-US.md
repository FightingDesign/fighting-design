## explain

Your component development directory is here

You can write test code at will in `App.vue` and the original code can be deleted and modified at will

## Development phase

In `main.ts`, components developed under `fighting-design/packages` can be directly introduced in the following ways

```ts
import FightingDesign from '../../packages/fighting-design/index'
import '@fighting-design/fighting-theme'
```

## Packaging phase

If you want to test whether your package file can work normally after you execute `pnpm build`, you can import the components under `dist` directory for testing in the following way

```ts
import FightingDesign from '../dist'
import '../dist/dist/index.css'
```
