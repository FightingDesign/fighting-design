## Write in front

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome use `Fighting Design`!

I am glad that you are interested in contributing to `Fighting Design`. Before submitting your contribution, be sure to take a moment to read the following guidelines.

There may be many specifications, but most of them are small specifications. Please read them carefully.

## Plagiarism is prohibited

As we all know, there are many component libraries on the market. Many of the new components we need to develop have already been developed on the market, but do not directly copy other third-party source codes for use!

Developing a component library is a process of learning and progress. Don't just add components for the sake of adding new components. I hope that participants can learn something in the process of adding new components to improve their skills. If you encounter difficulties with a certain function in the development stage, you can initiate a [discussions](https://github.com/FightingDesign/fighting-design/discussions), or you can contact me directly or ask for help in the group. Of course, it is also possible to learn and refer to other open source libraries. I just hope that when you write, you have understood the problem and practice it yourself.

## Start project

Before you make a contribution, you need to run the `Fighting Design` project. Then you need to:

- Install [node](http://nodejs.cn),version `>= 16`
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/zh/),the latest version is enough

If you are ready, you can skip directly and start from here:

- `Fork` [fighting-design](https://github.com/FightingDesign/fighting-design)
- `Clone fork` items locally

Next, execute the command:

```shell
# Enter project directory
cd fighting-design

# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Start development project
pnpm start
```

## Commit specification

[Git](https://git-scm.com) allows us to attach a submission information as a description each time we submit. When we execute a `commit`, we need to fill in the description information in strict accordance with the specification below. The submission information must be one of the following information, followed by the `colon + space + information in English`

For example:

```shell
git commit -m 'feat: Add XXX function'
```

The type must be one of the following types and filled in against the type description.

However, `Fighting Design` has built-in [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) plug-in to assist us in adding submission information, so we need to execute the following commands:

```shell
git add .

# Use the prompt of the plug-in to set the submission information
pnpm commit

git push
```
